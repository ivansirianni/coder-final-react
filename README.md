# IvoDev Gaming Store.
Welcome to my store. This project is the final challenge of the FrontEnd Development Career in Coderhouse.
At this project I created an Ecommerce where you can buy different kinds of gaming things.

# How it works?
At the main page you will find some information about the page, a list of all products available to buy, a NavBar and a Footer:
  * ## NavBar:
     You can find a Logo thay if you click it wherever in page, you will be redirected to home. After that you will find Home, About US, Store and Order. By clicking on them you will be redirecting to diferent sections with all information about. And in the final, a Cart icon, you can find all your items u are buying into the cart only by clicking on the icon. It will show how many items you have inside.
  * ## Footer:
    You will find some information about the store, some links like in the menu and social networks icons
  * ## Products:
    Every product has some information like price, name and a picture. Then abutton to view more information about it.
    By Clicking there, you will be redirecting to a detailed section where you will know a bit more about the product, the stock and so. You will be find also some buttons to choose how many items you want to purchase, then another button to ADD TO CART and another to navigate to home.
    If you choose ADD TO CART, you will be looking at the cart icon a red bubble with the amount of items you chose. Click on it and will be redirecting to the final stage.
    At the Cart section you will see the final amount of all items you choose. Also, you will see all items inside the cart and will have the posibility to CLEAN THE CART to delete them all, or a single removing item option by clicking on remove item.
    If you wanna finish the proccess and buy the items, click on generate order, and will be redirecting automatically to complete a form. Complete all the information and click on Finish Transaction. And then, you will be looking on screen a modal with the transaction ID.
    If you go now at this step to the Orders option on menu, you will se a card with all the information about your transaction.
